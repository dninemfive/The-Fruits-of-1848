US History first diverges in this timeline when Franklin Pierce chooses a different Secretary of War from Jefferson Davis, meaning the Gadsden Purchase is never made. The South, then, has a harder time shipping goods across the US, and Mexico profits from transit taxes as the railroad is still built through the area. During the Civil War, the Trent Affair leads the paranoid Queen Victoria to secretly support the Confederacy on the condition that they attack Spanish colonies in the Caribbean - they agree, and successfully invade Cuba and Puerto Rico while Spain is distracted by Juan Prim's rebellion, even as they lose the mainland by 1867 and negotiate a ceasefire with only the islands remaining. Dominica repulses their attacks and remains independent, as does Haiti. Dominica, however, successfully lobbies a later American administration to annex them. Lincoln promotes a more moderate but consistent Reconstruction, successfully granting freedmen greater suffrage than in our timeline, helped by the fact that prominent Southern racists migrate to the Confederate Antilles. By 1898, the South is beginning to stabilize and some are advocating for the occupation of over four decades to be lifted. 

Misc:
- owns Dominica as a puppet, purchased in 1870. Some focuses deal with the constitutionality of unrepresented territories.
- May get a Maine-equivalent event in either the CSA or the Philippines based on in-game factors
- Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Arizona start uncored, perhaps even as puppets. A focus chain grants cores (and annexes?) on these states
