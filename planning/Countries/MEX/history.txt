Starts out mostly similar in this timeline, but diverges as Porfirio Diaz remains loyal to Juarez and then Lerdo. The latter is reelected twice for three terms total and primarily achieves political reforms (particularly centralization of the country by eliminating local caudillos) and infrastructural development. In the election of 1884, Jose Maria Iglesias wins despite Lerdo's political connections and vote-rigging and launches a progressive campaign of political and economic reforms, including his anticlerical measures but also setting a (low) minimum wage and establishing an independent electoral commission, reducing corruption. He is not, however, reelected, as Porfirio Diaz wins a minor landslide against him with the support of corporations and Catholic voters. He rolls back some reforms, but is unable to rig elections and loses in 1892. He is succeeded by the aging but competent Vicente Riva Palacio, who is halfway through a second uneventful term in 1898, when he dies.

More prosperous in TTL due to the railroad tax.
