At the tail end of the Spring of Nations, the Dutch decided to invade and annex Flanders in order to boost popular support for the monarchy. This created a crisis, with the newly-formed German and French governments deciding to intervene for and against the Dutch, respectively. The Franco-German War of 1849 lasted about three years, with the French taking an early lead and occupying the Low Countries but ultimately being beaten back by Germany. The peace treaty partitioned Belgium between France (as the puppet Wallonia) and the Netherlands. During the war, the republican French forces forced out the Dutch monarchs, and when they tried to return after the war Dutch republicans kept them out, supported by the parliament; Germany refused to intervene. The Dutch Republic took control of most (maybe all) Dutch colonies in the Americas, but the Monarchy retained control over and retreated to the Dutch East Indie

As of the game start, the ruling Dutch party is Market Liberal, with Social Liberal and Conservative minorities.
