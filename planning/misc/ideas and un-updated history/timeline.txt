# 1848
- The Sicilian Republic is established. ITTL, it is not successfully reconquered due to handwaving
- The revolt in Germany is successful because Austria and Prussia severely injured each other's armies due to suspicions of their ambitions, leading to a coalition of west-German states winning; the German Empire is established, releasing Austria's Yugoslav territories, Czesko, Prussian Poland, &c. The Habsburgs are dethroned, sending their heirs to the remaining monarchies, while the Prussians are established as titular Kaisers.
- A minor serf-revolt moves forward their liberation a couple years, but it doesn't happen in 1848.
- The Republic of San Marco is founded and immediately defends Sicily against the Kingdom of Naples, strengthening ties
- The UK bungles Irish famine response even more, cementing their hatred of the English.
# 1853
- The Gadsden Purchase is not made and filibustering peters out; Mexico will later sign a treaty allowing the construction of a railroad through the territory in exchange for the ability to tax trains therethrough
# 1861
- The Southern states rebel as in OTL; however, a paranoid Victoria sends arms and supports their invasion of Spanish territories in the Caribbean (asuming she'll annex them later)
# 1865
- The South is defeated (again, as in OTL); it is allowed to retain Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Dominica as Lincoln prioritizes reuniting the US and ending slavery there
- Lincoln is not assassinated, and will finish his term promoting his brand of reconstruction
# 1871
- Dutch-Belgian War: a proxy war between Germany and France, backing the Netherlands and Belgium, respectively; German mastery of railways lets them supply the Dutch more quickly and therefore they defeat the Belgians and annex Flanders. In a compromise, Germany agrees to depose the Dutch monarch in the settlement and they flee to Dutch Indonesia, where they seize power. The new government is too divided to pursue the colony and does not.
# 1878
- A second campaign of Irish assassinations and risings in both Ireland and the Cape Colony prevent the UK from defeating Cetshwayo; he secures Boer backing with the cession of Vryheid and defeats the smaller expeditionary force
# 1896
- Unrest in the Ottoman's Balkan territories reaches a breaking point, and the independent states of Greece, Bulgaria, and Serbia break away, supported by Yugoslavia. The Kurds and Arabs in the east sense their opportunity and declare independence as well, forming the Emirate of Arabia and the Republic of Kurdistan. The Empire is unable to address both rebellions and makes peace in the West, but suffers from guerilla warfare in the west. The conflict is still continuing at a stalemate as of 1898.
